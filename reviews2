He was very good. 
Glamorous stars, foreign locales and lavishly-filmed songs are mandatory in his movies. 
With RANGREZZ, he delves into the realistic world for the first time. Ditto for Priyadarshan, who returns to hard-hitting, gritty cinema that you appreciated and applauded in his earlier films, especially GARDISH. Of course, RANGREZZ is not as hard-hitting as those films, but it takes the realistic route like those fares. The terrain, once again, is a crowded basti of Mumbai, which has been explored over and over again.
Remake of the Tamil film NAADODIGAL [2009], which was remade in various Indian languages subsequently, RANGREZZ is essentially a tale of friendship, with a love story integrated in the plotline. Sadly, it runs out of fizz in its post-interval portions, after leaving quite an impression in the first hour.
RANGREZZ narrates the story of three friends who attempt to unite another friend with his lady-love. In the process, each of them loses something precious. Consequently, the trio gets a rude shock when they realize that the hardships they encountered to unite the lovers has proved meaningless, as the lovers decide to go separate ways owing to differences.
A simplistic plot, humble setting and straight-forward storytelling... RANGREZZ arrives without the usual frills and trappings of a masala movie. The story is not path-breaking, but what works -- in the first hour at least -- is the realistic milieu and the age-old philosophy that enduring friendship can overcome all odds, with friends standing by each other through thick and thin. Priyadarshan and writer Mushtaq Shiekh incorporate a number of sequences that stay with you -- some sweet, some true-to-life, some funny. The entire kidnap drama prior to the intermission is simply outstanding and raises [monumental] expectations from the second hour.
